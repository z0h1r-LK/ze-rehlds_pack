# To do:
~~Create script with Python or Bash Script to install everything with one tap~~

# Tutorial:
* Download `hlds_run` from the [Releases](https://github.com/z0h1r-LK/ze-rehlds_pack/releases/latest) page.
* If you have old HLDS files, delete all of them to keep the server directory empty.
* Upload the `hlds_run` file to your server using File Manager or FTP.
* Set permissions to `777` for `hlds_run`.
  * Give all permissions to file RWX (Read, Write and Execute) on Owner, Group and Public.
* Start the server and wait for the installation to complete.
* Restart the server. If it doesn't start properly, try again several times.
